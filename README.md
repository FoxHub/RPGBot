RPGBot is a game master's friend, written in Python 3.6.2. I designed
it for personal purposes, but it should be well-commented enough to
expand upon and configure for your own Discord server.

RPGBot is licensed under the MIT license, which allows you to copy,
modify, and distribute it with attribution. See LICENSE.txt for details.


## Installation and Usage

Make sure you have [Python 3.6.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
Then, you can use pip to install the requirements from requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, RPG-Bot's `config.json-EXAMPLE` must be renamed to `config.json` and filled with real
production data.
